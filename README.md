An online to-do list project involves creating a web application that allows users to manage their tasks and responsibilities in an organized and efficient manner. The application typically includes features such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks, setting deadlines, prioritizing tasks, categorizing tasks into different lists, and receiving reminders for important tasks. Additionally, the application may also allow users to collaborate with others by sharing tasks and lists, and delegating tasks to other team members. The goal of this project is to provide users with a simple and effective tool for managing their daily workload and increasing productivity.
